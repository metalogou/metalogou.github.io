My name is Nick. I am a layabout and amateur student living in Detroit. The purpose of this project is to work through traditional difficulties pertaining to theoretical and practical thought. My approach is through these topics as they are taken up by two related contemporary research programs in philosophy: analytic German Idealism and Neo-Aristotelian naturalism.
