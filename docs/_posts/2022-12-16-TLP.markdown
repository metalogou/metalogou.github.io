This book will perhaps only be understood by those who have themselves already thought the thoughts which are expressed in it—or similar thoughts. It is therefore not a text-book. Its object would be attained if it afforded pleasure to one who read it with understanding.  
The book deals with the problems of philosophy and shows, as I believe, that the method of formulating these problems rests on the misunderstanding of the logic of our language. Its whole meaning could be summed up somewhat as follows: What can be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent.  
The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought).  
The limit can, therefore, only be drawn in language and what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense.  
How far my efforts agree with those of other philosophers I will not decide. Indeed what I have here written makes no claim to novelty in points of detail; and therefore I give no sources, because it is indifferent to me whether what I have thought has already been thought before me by another.  
I will only mention that to the great works of Frege and the writings of my friend Bertrand Russell I owe in large measure the stimulation of my thoughts.  
If this work has a value it consists in two things. First that in it thoughts are expressed, and this value will be the greater the better the thoughts are expressed. The more the nail has been hit on the head.—Here I am conscious that I have fallen far short of the possible. Simply because my powers are insufficient to cope with the task.—May others come and do it better.  
On the other hand the *truth* of the thoughts communicated here seems to me unassailable and definitive. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the problems have in essentials been finally solved. And if I am not mistaken in this, then the value of this work secondly consists in the fact that it shows how little has been done when these problems have been solved.

The world is determined by the facts, and by these being *all* the facts.  
&nbsp;  
1.12  
For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.  
&nbsp;  
1.13  
The facts in logical space are the world.

The logical picture of the facts is the thought. </summary><blockquote>

3.0

3.1  
In the proposition the thought is expressed perceptibly through the senses.

3.2  
In propositions thoughts can be so expressed that to the objects of the thoughts correspond the elements of the propositional sign.

3.3  
Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.

3.4  
The proposition determines a place in logical space: the existence of this logical place is guaranteed by the existence of the constituent parts alone, by the existence of the significant proposition.

3.5  
The applied, thought, propositional sign is the thought.

The thought is the significant proposition. </summary><blockquote>

4.0

4.1  
A proposition presents the existence and nonexistence of atomic facts.

4.2  
The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with the possibilities of the existence and non-existence of the atomic facts.

4.3  
The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions mean the possibilities of the existence and non-existence of the atomic facts.

4.4  
A proposition is the expression of agreement and disagreement with the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions.

4.5  
Now it appears to be possible to give the most general form of proposition; *i*.*e*. to give a description of the propositions of some one sign language, so that every possible sense can be expressed by a symbol, which falls under the description, and so that every symbol which falls under the description can express a sense, if the meanings of the names are chosen accordingly.  
It is clear that in the description of the most general form of proposition only what is essential to it may be described—otherwise it would not be the most general form.  
That there is a general form is proved by the fact that there cannot be a proposition whose form could not have been foreseen (*i*.*e*. constructed). The general form of proposition is: Such and such is the case.

Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.  
(An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.) </summary><blockquote>

5.0

5.1  
The truth-functions can be ordered in series.

5.2  
The structures of propositions stand to one another in internal relations.

5.3  
All propositions are results of truth-operations on the elementary propositions.  
The truth-operation is the way in which a truth-function arises from elementary propositions.  
According to the nature of truth-operations, in the same way as out of elementary propositions arise their truth-functions, from truth-functions arises a new one. Every truth-operation creates from truth-functions of elementary propositions another truth-function of elementary propositions, *i*.*e*. a proposition. The result of every truth-operation on the results of truth-operations on elementary propositions is also the result of *one* truth-operation on elementary propositions.  
Every proposition is the result of truth-operations on elementary propositions.

5.4  
Here it becomes clear that there are no such things as "logical objects" or "logical constants" (in the sense of Frege and Russell).

5.5  
Every truth-function is a result of the successive application of the operation (-----T)(*ξ*,....) to elementary propositions.  
This operation denies all the propositions in the right-hand bracket and I call it the negation of these propositions.

5.6   
*The limits of my language* mean the limits of my world.

The general form of truth-function is: [*p̄*, *ξ̄*, *N*(*ξ̄*)].  
This is the general form of proposition. </summary><blockquote>

6.0

6.1  
The propositions of logic are tautologies.

6.2  
Mathematics is a logical method.  
The propositions of mathematics are equations, and therefore pseudo-propositions.

6.3  
Logical research means the investigation of *all regularity*. And outside logic all is accident.

6.4  
All propositions are of equal value.

6.5  
For an answer which cannot be expressed the question too cannot be expressed.*The riddle* does not exist.  
If a question can be put at all, then it *can* also be answered.
