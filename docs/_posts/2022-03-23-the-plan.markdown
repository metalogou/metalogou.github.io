There is a short outline of what I’m aiming at with this project, and how I intend to get there, under the heading “About.” I want to say something longer here about these, because that outline does not say much. On the assumption that any readers will likely be, in some way, trained philosophers, I’m going to begin by placing myself in a field of names. On the assumption that we may misunderstand one another using the same names, I’m going to end by getting clear about the issues that I want to take up.

##Names

The central figure in what follows will be Hegel. Aristotle will not be far off. This remove reflects the history of my own thinking, rather than a claim I want to make about their importance relative to each other. I read the one through the other, and take them to be articulating the same insight. I simply came to Hegel first.

Schematically, there are a few ways in which Hegel may be said to have enjoyed recent renewed interest. I’m going to list some of them so as to shed some light on the angle of my approach, mainly by saying which approaches are not my own. I have learned a great deal from scholars across these different routes to Hegel, but, for the most part, their starting points are not mine.
